	/*
	 * A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each
	 * unit there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone,
	 * but it must not jump into the water.
	 * 
	 * Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order,
	 * determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last
	 * stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first
	 * jump must be 1 unit.
	 * 
	 * If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k
	 * - 1, k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward
	 * direction.
	 * 
	 * Notice The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1100. Each stone's position
	 * will be a non-negative integer < 2^31. The first stone's position is
	 * always 0.
	 * 
	 * Example Given stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
	 * 
	 * There are a total of 8 stones. The first stone at the 0th unit, second
	 * stone at the 1st unit, third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on... The last
	 * stone at the 17th unit.
	 * 
	 * Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the
	 * 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone,
	 * then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to
	 * the 8th stone.
	 * 
	 * Given stones = `[0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]`
	 * 
	 * Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap
	 * between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
